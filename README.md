# Autodidacticism

In this repository, you will find some of my notes as I explore a variety of subjects ranging from mathematics and computer science to politics.

My notes are written in Markdown. Sometimes you might see the <hl> tag. I configured a custom .css file to highlight my text in blue, which happens after pandoc generated a .html file.
