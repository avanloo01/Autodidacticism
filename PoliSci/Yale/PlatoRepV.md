# Creation of just city (Kallipolis)

- thumos: <hl>having a heart</hl>, Chutzpah
$\implies$ pursue ambitions
- also desire for tyranny
$\implies$ dual
- every great leader accr. to Socrates

> Can it be controlled/rechanneled for public good?

# Introduction of problem

- story
- Leontius at walls
- saw corpses at execution place
- wanted to see, but disgusted
- <hl>internal conflict</hl>

$\implies$ Ramp toerisme

- Socrates: "Mind your business"
- Leontius, proud, wants to be in control
    - isn't
- thumos can help achieve balance

# Can it be used in politics?

## Waves of reform

1. Restriction on priv. prop.
    - abolition
2. No family
3. Philosopher kings

### 1. Common ownership

- children equally neglected

### 2. Co-education

- laughable
- no job equally by men & women
- costs
    - competition
        - naked with Greeks
    - sex only for reproduction
        - old people w/ anyone they like
    - village to raise children
        - parents cannot know own children

## Rewrite laws of war

- teach children art of war
    - start education
- provide erotic rewards
    - <hl>kiss anyone they like</hl>
    $\implies$ incentive for going to war

## Platonic idea of justice

- harmony
    - in city & soul
- justice <hl>binds city</hl>
- job that naturally suits you
    - *who decides this*
    - *shouldn't individuals be free*
- 3 classes express 3 parts of soul
    - ruling, spirit & appetite
    - kings, warriors, workers

# Is the structure of a city ~ soul

- 3 parts of soul
    - 1 task in social hierarchy
- Socrates: *only 1 dominant*
- doesn't rely on all
    - guadians rule w/ <hl>deception</hl>

## how can this be just?

- they don't necessarily have platonically just souls
- people not necessarily happy
- guardian all responsibi
    - no rewards

$\implies$Socr: not looking for happiness, but city as a whole

- challenger accepts it

# Philosopher-king

- very important to Plato & book
- proposal might be ironical
    - would discredit idea
- prof: not entirely impossible
    - Plato served as adviser in Sicily
- Hobbes
    - also fears unability for change
    - recovers hope
        - maybe sovereign will find it one day
- Philospher: knowledge/dreamer; Politics: more practical

# What unity did he want

- philosopher = also humans
    - would also possibly abuse power
- dialogue ended in failure

# View on America

- anti-democratic
- minding your own business <-> citizens can participate
- Plato: democracy = anything you want
    - not same as America
- Plato: democratic man
    - changes mind quick
    - chaotic
$\implies$not like one man one job

- similar to curr. democracy
- say what ever comes to lips
    - bad for Plato

## not all negative

- democracy $\implies$ Socrates
    - philosophize freely
$\implies$democracy is the worst regime, except for all the others

## function Kallipolis

- philosopher-king = hope
    - shouldn't be expected
- metaphor
    - self-control = in our power
    - change happens within first
- many corpses: believed to be philosopher-kings
    - pretentions of vanity & ambition
- therapy for passions, limits to desires
<-> tyrants

- philosophy = liberaty, therapy of soul/desire to dominate & tyranny

> we should encourage 1 side/other
> Marx: who will educate the educators?
