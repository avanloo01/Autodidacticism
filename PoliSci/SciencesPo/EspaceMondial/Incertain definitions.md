- Identity = difficult concept

> problem = crossing issue

# 1. Rediscover concept inter. actor

- free of constraints/determined by culture
- how individual = built = difficult

# 2. Type of pol. system

- is it normal to say *muslim political system*
- useful?

# 3. Intern. relations

- clash of civilizations?

# 4. Situation made by cultural differences/interpreted through culture

- who makes the issues

# Definition

- sociological $\implies$ no identity shaping us
- *how to define myself?*
$\implies$ it's a <hl>decision</hl>/strategy

## Instable

- not permanent
- structuring behavior in a moment

## Volatile

- one context, Muslim; other, Iraqi


$\implies$ identity manipulated by pol. entrepreneurs
(according to expectations)

$\implies$ identify to group & culture

# culture

- not just values
- confilct in values in countries, e.g.
- Geertz: culture = system of feelings
    - allows individuals to understand each other

## No homogenous cultural space

- permanent hibridization
- system should coincide w/ immagined community
