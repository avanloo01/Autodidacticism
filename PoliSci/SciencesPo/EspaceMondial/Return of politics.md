- Political nature of identities

*Politics is back* $\implies$ politics still shaping identity

- identity not only politcal substrate, constantly manipulated
    - expression, mobilization, legitimization
    $\implies$ diff. levels of identity

# Case: Indian partition

- identary partition at first look: muslims & hindoes
- both founders of Pakistan & India = secular
- main reason = politcal condition

# Why so much political manipulation in identity

## Ideological collapse 

- identity more able to mobilize people

## Institutional collapse

- state less & less legitimate $\implies$ move to culture & identity

## Empire collapse

- defining international context

## Integration collapse

- low HDI $\implies$ back to own identity

# Result

- close to anarchy
- before: national order structured arena
- identity doesn't create order

> identity doesn't consider alterity
> only vision of self

- problem = relation between identity and nation
    - identity only based on ethnicity
    - nation territory
    $\implies$ cannot be transferred
