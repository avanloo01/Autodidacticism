# How do they interplay?

- traditionally: states only authorized players
- now: diff. actors & diff. strategies

$\implies$ 2 orientations

## Autonomy

- non-states protect Autonomy

## Cooperation w/ others

- horizontal: between orgs
- vert: between nation-state & its society

$\implies$ intermestic world

# How

- nation-states used to dominate int. rel. & was simple


## New

1. identity entrepreneurs
    - exclusive
    - part of world
        - same identity
2. transnationl //
    - inclusive
    - global market
    - medias, corps & NGOs

> three angles in tension

- threat of sovereignty (trans <-> nation)
- nations <-> identity: traitors
- trans. <-> id. : Gemeinschaft/Wirschaft

$\implies$ cannot work w/o each other
$\implies$ *How to balance?*

> If actors coexist & cooperate $\implies$ peace
