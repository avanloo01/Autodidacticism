- 2 visions of exclusions

# Traditional

- resilience of states
- benign leader = necessity to stabilize int. order
- hard power didn't work when globalization ‚òù
$\implies$ move to soft power
$\implies$ cultural hegemony
    - e.g., American films

## Is culutral hegemony sufficient?

- can be strengthened w/o political power

# New: inequalities

- energy & food resources lack
    - permanent tensions
- inequality of income
- inequality of trade
$\implies$ difficult to promote integrating world

## political aspect

- int. clubs
- P5, G7, IMF, etc.

<br/>

- cultural inequality
    - cultures submitted by outsiders
- social exclusions
    - gap between hegemons & lowest.
