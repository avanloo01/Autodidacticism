    - common goods for global survival
- Global neighborhood
    - cooperation between public & private actors

# Traditional, liberal vision of world order

    - competition = invisible hand

# Limits & difficulties

- what institutions for this interaction
- take into account private actors
    - organize them
    - meet & cooperate
    - balance private & public
- social governance
    - promoting social development
    - human security
    $\implies$ modify our vision of others
- reduce illegal activities
    - drugs, maffia, slavery, etc.
    $\implies$ new order where they should be restricted

# Conclusion

    - easterners feel excluded & start defining own norms
