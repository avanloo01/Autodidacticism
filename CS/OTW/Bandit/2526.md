# 25 -> 26

- Finding ways to enumerate possible shells
    - `cat /etc/shells`
- `showtext` shell looks interesting
- running `showtext /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26`
    - `/home/bandit25/text.txt` not found
- looking at the script: more command
    - file perusal filter for crt viewing
    - similar to `less`
- we only have read and execute access
- found bandit25.sshkey
- creating text.txt: `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26`

## Writeup

- didn't know you could connect with ssh on same host
- didn't know you had to minimize your terminal window

`ssh -i bandit26.sshkey -t bandit26@localhost cat text.txt`
