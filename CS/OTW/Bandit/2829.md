# 28 -> 29

- using the same method as previously
- found readme file, but password is redacted
- trying to use file, gitk
    - no result
- `git log` on repo also didn't work

```bash
fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /tmp)
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
```

- found `edd935d60906b33f0619605abd1689808ccdd5ee`
    - doesn't work as password

## Writeup

- I had to use `git log` inside the repo
    - `git log -p -1`
