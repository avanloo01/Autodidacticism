# 26 -> 27

- ssh -p 2220 -t bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
- didn't work, and I didn't have any other ideas
- using the same method as the previous challenge also didn't work

## Writeup

- didn't know `:set shell=/bin/bash`
- `:shell`
- `./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27`
