# Level 23 -> 24

Made a script: `script.sh` in `/var/spool/banit24`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24
```

Executing the binary in `/usr/bin/crontab_bandit24.sh` leaves me with nothing.

## Checking a writeup

- understanding of the cronjob script was correct
- had to add `> /tmp/[FOLDER]/password` 
- didn't know about chmod 777
