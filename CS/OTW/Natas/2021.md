# 20 -> 21

- a main page and an experimental page
    - the main page will display the password when we have the correct session id
    - $_SESSION[$key] = $val; implies that we can update the admin to 1
        - the php code is still difficult
- Nice!
    - you use Burp to make a POST request on the experimental site
    - you change name and value to admin=1
    - you copy the cookie
    - paste the cookie on the main page & refresh
