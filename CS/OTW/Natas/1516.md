# 15 -> 16

- looking for CVEs for jquery 1.9.1 shows XSS could work
    - don't think this is the purpose of this level
- we need the `preg_match` to return false
    - we can't use ; | & ` ' "
- using unicode doesn't return `invalid characters`
    - strange
- tried encoding the exploit in bytes
    - \x3B\X20\X63\X61\X74\X20\X2F\X65\X74\X63\X2F\X6E\X61\X74\X61\X73\X5F\X77\X65\X62\X70\X61\X73\X73\X2F\X6E\X61\X74\X61\X73\X31\X37
    - \x3B\x20 cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas17
    - no result
- tried using # cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas17
- [this](https://www.secjuice.com/web-application-firewall-waf-evasion/) also didn't work
- time to learn something new ...
