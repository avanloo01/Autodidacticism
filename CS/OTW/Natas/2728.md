# 27 -> 28

- we have a joke database
- when we type in a term, the urlbar looks weird
    - cyberchef: the query is base64, but unreadable
- when I set the query to f
    - `PKCS#7 padding for blocksize`
        - this is AES
            - maybe custom AES
- Gobuster: doesn't offer anything

- first portion is always the same of base4
    - block by block encryption
    $\implies$ ECB encryption
