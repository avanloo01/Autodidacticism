# 8 -> 9

- tried looking at the source, but I didn't fully understand it
- I looked at the array_key_exists function, which made the whole thing clearer
- I still didn't know what to do
- I tried gobuster, but it didn't return anything
- I think I have to escape that grep statement

## Writeup

- I forgot about `;`
- I ran `xxxx directory.txt; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10`
