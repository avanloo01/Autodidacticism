# 30 -> 31

- file upload
- again Perl 😵‍💫
- maybe we could upload a reverse shell
    - since we haven't been doing these, I checked on a [writeup](https://caminek.rocks/2021/06/07/natas30-31/)
    - the writer again mentions a talk I didn't know
    $\implies$ I followed the code for `natas32.py`
