# 23 -> 24

- strcmp returns something >0 if string1 is greater than string2
    - aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa is wrong
- trying to return <0
    - also wrong
- if the passwd contains the first character output is smaller than 0
    - this will not work because ! will output a null value
- the password needs to be the same
- I built a multi-threaded password cracker ðŸ˜…
- further research shows I could bypass strcmp
    - using `passwd[]=i`
