# 21 -> 22

- there is a revelio variable & admin
- we need revelio to exist & admin to equal 1

$\implies$ simply doing this in the url bar didn't work

- when I fill in revelio=true using Burp
    - it brings me in an infinite loop
- tried different combinations of revelio and admin=1
    - always including revelio
    - nothing worked
