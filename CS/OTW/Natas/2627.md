# 26 -> 27

- database cleared every 5 min
- we can create new users & reload to show data
- I am not sure how to do this
    - we need natas28, but he isn't in the database (it gets cleared)
    - when I try to create natas28: wrong password
- reading [php docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php)
    - didn't work
- [tried this](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/72755/sql-injection-modify-insert-table-values)
    - didn't work

- I didn't think of a buffer overflow
