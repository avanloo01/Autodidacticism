# 22 -> 23

- `strstr` looks for the first occurrance
- the password should be longer than 10 chars & start w/ iloveyou
    - iloveyouaaa didn't work...
    - more a's also didn't work
- further examination shows the morla comment
    - this is probably the user who created it
- it's as if the strstr function should return a boolean
- I made sure the password started with 123
    - this made it larger than 10
- I also made sure there was something after iloveyou

`123iloveyou222`
