# 14 -> 15

- filling in natas16 shows that the user exitst
    - we need a way to obtain the password
    - tried `natas16 "or 1=1--`
        - by the source code this obviously doesn't work
- we need some way to print $res
- looking for a way to find php variables w/ Burp
- thinking about sqlmap
    - I don't know how to use authentication
    - using --cookie, but I need multiple cookies
        - using ;
    - cookies didn't work

```bash
sqlmap --headers="User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0" -u 'http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php' --cookie="__utma=176859643.714692903.1656580277.1656580277.1656667934.2; __utmb=176859643.4.10.1656667934; __utmt=1; __utmz=176859643.1656580277.1.1.utmcsr=(direct)|utmccn=(direct)|utmcmd=(none)"
```

- This was the last thing I tried
    - I will look at a writeup

## Writeup

- this is blind-based SQL injection
- copied [this Python script](https://www.abatchy.com/2016/11/natas-level-14-and-15)
- I didn't know how to use the `debug` tag
- I didn't know about HTTPBasicAuth in Python
- I didnt know about `LIKE BINARY`
