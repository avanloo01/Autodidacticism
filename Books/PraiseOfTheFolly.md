# Praise of the Folly -- Desiderius Erasmus

- it seems to me that whatever you do it always falls under the container of Craziness
- Erasmus adds so many examples to show that no one is really sane
- he doesn't seem to offer a solution

- implies that all human relations are based on the Folly
- I like the tale of Jupiter who had a bag of others' vices on his chest and one of his own on his back
